## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Collaboration utilizing a best practise GIT workflow
- Working with Next.js
- Using React Props to pass data between components
- Working with local JSON data to populate components while designing the app
